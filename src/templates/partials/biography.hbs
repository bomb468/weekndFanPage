                Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, 
                is a Canadian singer-songwriter and record producer.[2] Known for his sonic versatility 
                and dark lyricism, Tesfaye's music explores escapism, romance, and melancholia, and is 
                often inspired by personal experiences.[3] He has received numerous accolades, including 
                three Grammy Awards, nineteen Billboard Music Awards, fifteen Juno Awards, six American 
                Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and an Academy Award nomination.[4]

                Born and raised in Toronto, Tesfaye began his recording career in 2009 by anonymously 
                releasing music on YouTube. Two years later, he co-founded the XO record label and 
                released the critically acclaimed mixtapes House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes 
                of Silence, quickly gaining recognition for his dark style of contemporary and 
                alternative R&B, and for the mystique surrounding his identity.[5] In 2012, Tesfaye 
                signed with Republic Records and re-released the mixtapes in the compilation album 
                Trilogy. His debut studio album Kiss Land was released in 2013, which saw him experiment 
                with dark wave.
